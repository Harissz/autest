### BASE_OUB_WAVE_PLAN_MOCA_V001 
**Overview:** The initial stage in inventory allocation for outbound orders or shipments involves meticulously planning them into a wave. Prior to allocation, all orders must be seamlessly integrated into a wave structure. Facilitating this process is the Outbound Planner module, designed to streamline warehouse operations comprehensively.The test scenario outlined is focused on planning multiple orders that are part of a wave set, consolidating them into a singular wave for efficient management.

### BASE_OUB_WAVE_WAIT_REL_MOCA_V001
**Overview:** Pick release is the process of allocating the locations in the movement path for picked inventory to its destination, and releasing those picks so that operators can perform the work. During pick release, the application considers a group of picks in a wave, determines which picks are for work assignments and which are single picks, builds the work assignments, and then attempts to reserve locations for the entire group of picks. Pick release can be executed manually or set up for automatic processing based on specific pick release configurations. If there are one or more locations with capacity for the group, the picks are released; if there is not enough capacity for the group, the picks are not released.
