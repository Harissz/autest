## **Overview**

In this innovative approach, the selection of inventory for shipment precedes the determination of whether pallet building is suitable for packing. This method involves first selecting items from the available inventory and subsequently assessing their compatibility for pallet packing. By prioritizing inventory selection over the determination of the packing method, this process optimizes the efficiency of the packing process.

By following this streamlined approach, the packing process becomes more efficient and adaptable to varying inventory requirements. This method ensures that the most suitable items are selected for shipment before determining the most appropriate packing method, thereby enhancing overall warehouse productivity and order fulfillment efficiency.

## **Applicable versions**

This test is designed to support versions greater than **2008.x.x**, ensuring compatibility and smooth operation with the latest software releases. Users can confidently utilize this test, as it is optimized for newer versions while retaining a user-friendly testing process.

## **Test Arguments**

Test arguments are parameters or inputs that are passed to the test cases to customize the test execution. These arguments provide flexibility and allow for the reuse of the same test case with different sets of data or configurations. The input is as follows:

## **Applicable MOCA commands**

For Smart pallet build using the MOCA command, you can use the following command.

-   **uc_emulate_pick_cmd**

This command will trigger the Smart pallet build based on the predefined parameters and rules within the MOCA system.

## **Affected DB tables**

When Smart pallet build is created, the following database table is typically affected:

-   **Pckwrk_view**

This table likely contains information related to the work or tasks associated with building the pallets, such as the items to be included, quantities, locations, and other relevant details.
