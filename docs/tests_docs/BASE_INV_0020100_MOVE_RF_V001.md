## **Overview**


Moving a load from one location to another within a warehouse is a critical task in logistics management. This operation involves safely transporting the load while ensuring minimal disruption to warehouse operations. The process includes planning the movement, coordinating with warehouse personnel, and updating the inventory system. 

It's essential to use the appropriate equipment and follow safety protocols to prevent damage to the load and ensure the safety of personnel. Efficiently executing load movements helps maintain warehouse efficiency and timely order fulfillment.

**Applicable versions**

This test is designed to support versions greater than **2008.x.x**,
ensuring compatibility and smooth operation with the latest software
releases. Users can confidently utilize this test, as it is optimized
for newer versions while retaining a user-friendly testing process.

**Test Arguments**

Test arguments are parameters or inputs that are passed to the test
cases to customize the test execution. These arguments provide
flexibility and allow for the reuse of the same test case with different
sets of data or configurations. The input is as follows:


<!-- SMART_DOC_GEN_TEST_ARG - Start -->
<table>
<tr><th>Arguments</th><th>Argument Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>uc_dstloc</td><td>This is the location where the inventory will be created.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_dstloc_expr</td><td>If no destination location is provided, this expression is used to generate one. The default expression is "ADSTLOC" || @uc_test_exec_seqnum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_mov_lodnum_expr</td><td>Loads matching this wildcard are moved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_new_trknum</td><td>If we want to use a specific trknum, use this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_new_trknum_expr</td><td>To build a new truck number - expression.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_srcloc</td><td>Inventory is taken from this source location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_srcloc_expr</td><td>If the source location is not provided, this expression helps determine it. By default, it is 'ADSTLOC-' || @uc_test_exec_seqnum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_test_exec_seqnum</td><td>This gets a new value every time we run the test. It provides a mechanism to generate new data for every test in a predictable way.</td></tr>
<tr><td>wh_id</td><td>Choose the warehouse where you want to perform actions. If not provided, the system will use the warehouse from the source order.</td></tr>

**Step:5**

At this point we have to give it the next hop location (Destination
location) , After that you just need to click on move.

## **Applicable MOCA commands**
When picked inventory will be transported through a series of hops using
the MOCA command, you can use the following command.

-   **MOVE INVENTORY**

This command will trigger the picked inventory to be transported through
a series of hops based on the predefined parameters and rules within the
MOCA system.

## **Affected DB Tables**

When picked inventory will be transported through a series of hops,
the following database tables are typically affected:

-   **pckwrk_view**

-   **shipment_line**

-   **invlod**

-   **locmst**

These tables are likely to be updated or referenced as the picked
inventory is transported through the series of hops.
