## **Overview**

In the described use case, the system is designed to wait for an order to be dispatched, indicating a process that involves monitoring the status of an order until it reaches the "dispatched" state. This likely involves a system that tracks orders and their statuses, possibly interfacing with other systems or components that handle the actual dispatching process. The waiting mechanism may involve periodic checks of the order status or subscribing to notifications or events that indicate when an order has been dispatched. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that downstream processes or actions dependent on the order being dispatched are triggered at the right time.

To implement this use case effectively, the system needs to have a robust mechanism for tracking and managing order statuses. It should be able to handle various scenarios, such as delays or errors in the dispatch process, and provide visibility into the status of each order.

## **Applicable versions**

This test is designed to support versions greater than **2008.x.x**,
ensuring compatibility and smooth operation with the latest software
releases. Users can confidently utilize this test, as it is optimized
for newer versions while retaining a user-friendly testing process.

## **Test Arguments**

Test arguments are parameters or inputs that are passed to the test
cases to customize the test execution. These arguments provide
flexibility and allow for the reuse of the same test case with different
sets of data or configurations. The input is as follows:

**Step:5**

Click **Plan Wave.**

![](BASE_OUB_0300000_WAIT_ORD_DISPATCH_MOCA_V001/image5.png)

**Step:6**

Open that Plan wave and go to the '**Actions**' tab and pick '**Allocate Wave (Planned)**'.

![](BASE_OUB_0300000_WAIT_ORD_DISPATCH_MOCA_V001/image6.png)

**Note**: Picks in a specific LPN level are released whenever the check box for the LPN level is selected for immediate release or when all three LPN levels are deselected.

## **Applicable MOCA commands**

To dispatch order using the MOCA command, you can use the following command.

- ord dispatched

This command will trigger the dispatch order based on the predefined parameters and rules within the MOCA system.

## **Affected DB tables**

The following database table is typically affected while dispatching the order:

- **Order**
- **Shipment**
- **Shipment_line**

These tables are likely to be affected to ensure proper tracking and management of the dispatch process and associated shipments.
