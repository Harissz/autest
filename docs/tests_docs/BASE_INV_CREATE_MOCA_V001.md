## **Overview**

The Inventory Create feature allows users to input a variety of items
and their corresponding attributes with precision. This includes details
such as product descriptions, materials, quantities, and specific
storage locations. By doing so, users can maintain accurate and
up-to-date records of their inventory. Additionally, this functionality
enables users to efficiently create multiple pallets within specified
locations, streamlining the overall inventory management process.

Users can leverage the Inventory Create feature to input diverse items
and their associated attributes accurately. This includes specifying
details such as product descriptions, materials, quantities, and
specific storage locations. By doing so, users can ensure the
maintenance of precise and current inventory records. Furthermore, this
functionality empowers users to effortlessly generate multiple pallets
within designated locations, thereby enhancing the efficiency of their
inventory management processes.

## **Applicable versions**

This test is designed to support versions greater than **2008.x.x**,
ensuring compatibility and smooth operation with the latest software
releases. Users can confidently utilize this test, as it is optimized
for newer versions while retaining a user-friendly testing process.

## **Test Arguments**

Test arguments are parameters or inputs that are passed to the test
cases to customize the test execution. These arguments provide
flexibility and allow for the reuse of the same test case with different
sets of data or configurations. The input is as follows:


<!-- SMART_DOC_GEN_TEST_ARG - Start -->
<table>
<tr><th>Arguments</th><th>Argument Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Ftpcod</td><td>This specifies the footprint to use. If not provided, the footprint returned by prtftp for the part is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>inv_attr_str1</td><td>Inventory attribute strings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>inv_attr_str2</td><td>Inventory attribute strings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>inv_attr_str3</td><td>Inventory attribute strings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>inv_attr_str4</td><td>Inventory attribute strings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>inv_attr_str5</td><td>Inventory attribute strings.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Invsts</td><td>If not provided, the receive status from prtmst is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lotnum</td><td>This specifies the lot to use. If not provided, the lot with the latest expiration date is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>new_untqty</td><td>This specifies the quantity of the newly created inventory. If not provided, it defaults to the unit quantity per pallet.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orgcod</td><td>If not provided, the receive status from prtmst is used.</td></tr>

<tr><td>uc_lodnum_prefix</td><td>This is the prefix for newly created loads. If provided, the loads are created with this prefix followed by the sequence number. If not provided, the loads are created with the next available load number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_template_dstloc</td><td>If no destination location is provided, this location is copied to create a new storage location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_test_exec_seqnum</td><td>During each run, uc_test_exec_seqnum generates unique base-36 value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>wh_id</td><td>This is the warehouse ID where the inventory will be created.</td></tr>
