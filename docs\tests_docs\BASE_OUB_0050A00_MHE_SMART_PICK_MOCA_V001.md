## **Test Category**

**‚òê** Custom  
**üóπ** Smart IS  
**‚òê** Standard

## **Overview**

In this innovative approach, Material Handling Equipment (MHE) is employed to efficiently execute order picking tasks within a specified wave, following the established standards of Smart IS implementations. By leveraging MHE capabilities, this method enhances order picking processes, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in warehouse operations. This approach integrates seamlessly with Smart IS systems, providing a reliable and standardized solution for order fulfillment within warehouse environments.

Users adopting this concept can expect improved order picking efficiency and accuracy, thanks to the precision and automation offered by MHE. By adhering to Smart IS standards, this approach ensures compatibility and interoperability with existing systems, minimizing integration complexities. Overall, this innovative concept offers a streamlined and effective solution for order picking, enhancing warehouse operations' productivity and reliability.

## **Applicable versions**

This test is designed to support versions greater than **2008.x.x**, ensuring compatibility and smooth operation with the latest software releases. Users can confidently utilize this test, as it is optimized for newer versions while retaining a user-friendly testing process.

## **Test Arguments**

Test arguments are parameters or inputs that are passed to the test cases to customize the test execution. These arguments provide flexibility and allow for the reuse of the same test case with different sets of data or configurations. The input is as follows:


<!-- SMART_DOC_GEN_TEST_ARG - Start -->
<table>
<tr><th>Arguments</th><th>Argument Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>schbat</td><td>If you don't provide a schedule batch, we'll use the uc_schbat_expr to create one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_call_complete_api</td><td>Determines if we should call the underlying pick API. Default to 1, meaning yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_emulate_pick_cmd</td><td>This command is used to pick one request number. If not specified, the default is 'emulate usr mhe process wrkque'. If you provide a different command, we'll look for it as an LES command.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_get_inventory_cmd</td><td>This command retrieves inventory for picking. By default, it uses 'get_usr_inventory_for_pick_emulation'. If you specify a different command, we'll use that instead.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_oprcod_expr</td><td>These are the operation codes we'll use for filtering data. By default, we look for codes starting with 'UC%'.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_oprcod_list</td><td>Rather than passing in uc_oprcod_expr, we can pass a SQL compatible list of operation codes. Default is nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_pick_is_last</td><td>Indicates if this is the last pick of the group. By default, it's set to 1, meaning yes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_pick_to_lodnum</td><td>If you specify a pick-to-load number, we'll use that. Otherwise, we'll intelligently determine the default.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_schbat_expr</td><td>If you don't specify a schedule batch (schbat), we will create one using 'ADATAW-' || @uc_test_exec_seqnum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>uc_test_exec_seqnum</td><td>During each run, it generates a unique base-36 value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wh_id</td><td>If you don't specify a warehouse ID, we'll use the one from the schedule batch.</td></tr>
